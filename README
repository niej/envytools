= Building, installing =

Dependencies: libarchive, lua, libxml2, flex, bison, pkg-config
Optional dependencies needed by nva: libpciaccess
Optional dependencies needed by vdpow: vdpau, libx11

If your distribution has -dev or -devel packages, you'll also need ones
corresponding to the dependencies above.

To build, use

 $ mkdir build
 $ cd build
 $ meson setup ..
 $ meson compile

To install [which is optional], use
