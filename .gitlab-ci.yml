# This is the tag of the docker image used for the build jobs. If the
# image doesn't exist yet, the containers stage generates it.
#
# In order to generate a new image, one should generally change the tag.
# While removing the image from the registry would also work, that's not
# recommended except for ephemeral images during development: Replacing
# an image after a significant amount of time might pull in newer
# versions of gcc/clang or other packages, which might break the build
# with older commits using the same tag.
#
# After merging a change resulting in generating a new image to the
# main repository, it's recommended to remove the image from the source
# repository's container registry, so that the image from the main
# repository's registry will be used there as well.
